# Final Project

## Week 1

This week I completed my research on the hurricanes. I obtained numbers that show the scale of each, how they impacted specific areas and why they are important. I also obtained the rainfall data for specific areas in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. This part I had a bit more trouble with. I thought it would be easy to find rainfall data, but I actually found it difficult to get amounts for specific areas. However, I was able to find the data, and now I can move forward without worrying about it. I also completed the map of Texas with this information put in, which I am happy with. I chose the "Light" map, because I thought it would make the markers stand out more, and I am pleased with the results. I will use this map for Florida and Puerto Rico, which I will complete next week. Lastly, I sketched a design of how I want the site to look when everything is done. I would like a navigation bar at the top to take people down to each map.
