# Final Project

## Week 1

This week I completed my research on the hurricanes. I obtained numbers that show the scale of each, how they impacted specific areas and why they are important. I also obtained the rainfall data for specific areas in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. This part I had a bit more trouble with. I thought it would be easy to find rainfall data, but I actually found it difficult to get amounts for specific areas. However, I was able to find the data, and now I can move forward without worrying about it. I also completed the map of Texas with this information put in, which I am happy with. I chose the "Light" map, because I thought it would make the markers stand out more, and I am pleased with the results. I will use this map for Florida and Puerto Rico, which I will complete next week. Lastly, I sketched a design of how I want the site to look when everything is done. I would like a navigation bar at the top to take people down to each map.

Here are the links to the data and information I used for my maps and top paragraphs:

## Week 2

This week I completed the next steps of my project, which were to create the Florida and Puerto Rico maps. For the most part, it was pretty straight forward and easy. The only trouble I ran into was that the data I had for Hurricane Maria didn't give the specific locations. To tackle this, I pulled up another map of Hurricane Maria without the rainfall data and compared the two to figure out the locations. I am also starting to think of the layout and CSS. I tried a scrollytelling method with Scrollama, but I had some trouble with it. I will focus on the layout portion in the following week though.

## Week 3

This week, I worked on the CSS for my project. However, before I could do that, I created a graph on my page that compared the average rainfall in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico to the rainfall each place experienced during the hurricanes. I also created an "About This Page" section where I talked about the work that went into this final project and linked all of my sources. I then worked on the CSS. I created margins around the maps to help with the scrolling issue. I also put margins around the body text and added a background color. I created font stacks and began to work on the media query, although I'm having some trouble with getting the maps to fully expand. I also created a navbar. Going forward, I need to fix the mobile-responsive design.
