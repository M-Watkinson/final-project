    <h1>The Impact</h1>
    <p>Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria devastated Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, respectively, in 2017. According to <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ewx/wxevent-2017harvey">the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, Hurricane Harvey was the first major hurricane to hit Texas since Hurricane Bret in 1999, and the first major hurricane to make landfall in the continental U.S. since Hurricane Wilma in 2005. Hitting Texas as a Category 4, winds reached more than 130 mph and some areas experienced more than 29 inches of rain.</p>
    <p>Hurricane Irma reached wind speeds of 185 mph, making it a Category 5 hurricane for three days, according to <a href="https://www.weather.gov/tae/Irma_technical_summary">the National Oceanic Atmospheric Association.</a> Irma caused flooding in parts of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, including large amounts of storm surge flooding and long periods of rain. It also caused more than 6.5 million customers in Florida to live without power.</p>
    <p>Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico as a Category 4, with winds stronger than 155 mph. Heavy rain caused flooding and did major damage, specifically to the Northern side of Puerto Rico, according to <a href="http://www.weather.gov/sju/maria2017">the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</a> Some areas also experienced more than 25 inches of rain. Damage was done to farms and houses, among other things, and more than 300 were sunk because of intense winds.</p>

        <h1>About This Page</h1>
        <p>This page was created by me, Mary-Lou Watkinson. I decided to choose the topic of the 2017 Hurricanes for two reasons. The first reason is that I felt it was an important topic. All three of the hurricanes discussed on this page broke records and caused extensive damage in the areas they hit, and I wanted to put that into perspective using rainfall data. The second reason was because I wanted to see how I could put that data into a visual format, which in the real world could be used with an extensive story about the impact of the hurricanes. I created a map for each hurricane/location and included the specific rainfall data (in inches) for each. I also created a graph that compares what the normal average rainfall is in each area compared to the average rainfall they received during the hurricanes. The research for this project took a lot more time than I anticipated, and it was more difficult to find all of the data than I previously thought it would be. Because of that, the research became a huge portion of this for me. However, I still put forth effort into each aspect of the project, and I have produced something that I am proud of. I found the rainfall data for my graph from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association for <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/normals">Texas</a>, <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/normals">Florida</a> and <a href="http://www.weather.gov/sju/climo01">Puerto Rico.</a> My rainfall data in my maps also came from the NOAA for <a href="http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html">Hurricane Harvey</a>, <a href="http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/storm20/stormsum_7.html">Hurricane Irma</a> and <a href="http://www.weather.gov/sju/maria2017">Hurricane Maria.</a> I hope you enjoy what I have created!</p>
